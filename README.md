# Readme
These codes are generated by Dr. Manish Kumar and Prof. Enrico Salvati
which can be used as a computational model to simulate the presence of
the secondary small phases present in the polycrystalline materials, 
e.g., inclusions, intermetallic, and many more. The provided codes can
be used to generate a mathematical domain to resemble actual microstructures,
which can be used in various micromechanical models. For instance, in crystal
plasticity, phase transformations, failure mechanisms through Phase-Filed or
Cohesive Zone Method, etc. The provided code is for the two-dimensional model
but can be easily extended to the three-dimensional problem.

The provided codes are developed using the Python API of Gmsh and 
FEniCS in the Python 3.0 environment in Ubuntu framework.
To use this code, installation instructions are as follows,

FEniCS installation:

        sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics
	
        sudo apt-get update
	
        sudo apt-get install fenics

more details can be found at the https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/

Gmsh installation:

        sudo apt-get update
	
        sudo apt-get install gmsh

Python API for Gmsh:

        pip install --upgrade gmsh
	
other external libraries used in the codes are: numpy and shapely.
Which can be install using following commands.

Numpy:

        pip install numpy

Shapely:

        pip install shapely

Two codes are provided: 
	
	1.	mesh_sub.py  => To generate 2D rectangular domain resembling
         	a polycrystalline material that contains the primary and secondary
		small subdomains using the Python API of the Gmsh library.

	2.	simulation_sub.py => To import the generated mesh, assign the 
	        different material properties to the domain and subdomains, 
		and simulate for the linear elastic isotropic material considering
		small-scale deformations using the Python API of the FEniCS library.

Command to convert .msh file into .xml

dolfin-convert inputmesh.msh outputmesh.xml.
